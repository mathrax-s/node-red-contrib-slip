# node-red-contrib-slip

The *node-red-contrib-slip* module adds [Serial Line Internet Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1055) packet encoding and decoding support to [Node-RED].

It is useful for packetising messages that are then sent over a stream,
such as a serial port or TCP socket.

    npm install node-red-contrib-slip

You will then be able to see the new SLIP node type added to Node-RED's pallet on the left.
